# HR-Analytics
Attendance Insights.
This Project is replicated from Codebasics PowerBi Youtube playlist.

# Problem Statement:
The Data Analytics team at AtliQ has been tasked with developing a comprehensive dashboard to address critical HR and management needs. In light of this, our mission is to strategically leverage data to optimize workforce management, enhance employee engagement, and improve cost-efficiency. The dashboard will primarily focus on understanding and visualizing employee work preferences, attendance patterns, and health-related metrics.

# Some Important Key Objectives:
1. Work from Home Insights: The primary objective is to create a data-driven understanding of the factors driving employees' choices to work remotely, particularly on Mondays or Fridays. The dashboard should provide insights that enable the refinement of remote work policies and initiatives.
2. Attendance Analysis: Aim to design a visual representation that highlights the percentage of employees present in the office on a weekly and monthly basis. This visualization will empower HR and management to make informed decisions regarding the scheduling of team-building activities and events.
3. Health and Well-being Metrics: The dashboard should include real-time monitoring of sick leave percentages among employees. This dynamic metric serves as an early warning system for health-related concerns, allowing the company to take proactive measures and enhance safety protocols.
4. Hybrid Work Capacity Planning: In anticipation of a hybrid work model, the dashboard should provide data-driven insights into office space utilization. This includes understanding how many employees are physically present in the office, enabling effective cost management and infrastructure optimization.

# Steps Followed in this project:
1. Loaded the Excel sheet data in Power query
2. Performed ETL and data cleaning on the imported data.
3. Performed the data transformations on one months attendance sheet and created a function for the performed steps. 
4. Then used the same function to perform data transformations on other months data and appended the data in single sheet.
5. Created measure and used them for creating visuals in PowerBi.
